Week 6 Lab: Updated 14 March 2020

Unfortunately due to being hung up on some errors, I have decided to
commit what I had up to this point. I will now go over what I had wrong:

a. In the Driver.java file, I wrote a function that read through all of
the addresses in a text file. I ran my function, and encountered a high
memory and RAM usage, which became a problem and caused a OutOfMemoryError.

b. I attempted to mitigate this by using another class, ZIPData.java.
The implementation caused a NullPointerExceptionError. This is where
I was stuck, and to accomodate time for the next lab's materials, I decided
to submit this as is.

I will do everything in my power to make sure something like this does not
happen again. This assignment was tough from start to finish, and making
the decision to push made me feel unhappy, but the best thing to say now
is at least I put in a good faith effort.

The code in the commit before this worked, but only had the classes required
for the second part. I did not get much done on the second part.

Old Notices: 11 March 2020

This project is still in progress as of 11 March 2020,
so this is just a back up of what I have worked on so far.

This note will be changed when the project is finished.
An extension was granted (until Monday, 16 March, so work submitted
here on Friday may still be code I am still working on.

All lab files are in the src folder, regardless of the current state
of the project.
