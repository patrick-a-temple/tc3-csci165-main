READ_ME.txt -> Chapter 5 Lab: Explanation on File Arrangement

For the lab, I wrote a .docx file called 'Debug Lab Write Up.docx'
within the lab directory, inside of week-5. However, for the Object Oriented
Programming section of the lab, I chose to store the source codes within
new folders. Within the new OOP-Section folder, I made two other folders,
each of them being named after their required class name (so one Temperature
folder and a CountyData2016 folder). This was done out of concern that the
multiple files already in the lab folder would make it harder to find the
files for that specific portion of the lab.

As of when I committed this file and the Debugger write up portion, I
had no files in the new folders, so they might not appear until I submit
these files in their respective folders.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
