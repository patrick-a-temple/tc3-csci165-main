Lab Assignment: Group Work 10 Points

Lab days will be spent working in groups. There will be a shorter group assignment followed by a
longer individual assignment. The group work is to be completed as a group with 10 points of the
overall lab grade dedicated to this effort. You will work in pairs (or maybe 3’s since the class has an
odd number of students and there are people who do not show up). Being absent does not excuse you
from this assignment.

My goal with this arrangement is to allow you to develop problem solving skills without relying on the
professor. This does not mean that I will not provide assistance or provide clarification when
instructions are a bit murky; but I want you to collaborate with your classmates. I think you will find
this arrangement enjoyable and beneficial despite the initial “ugh” moments of having to talk to other
humans :)
