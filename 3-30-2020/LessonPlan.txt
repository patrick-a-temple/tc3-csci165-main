Quarantined Quorum

Lesson Plan for Monday March 30 2020

    Greetings and salutations . . . mic check (make sure boomer can share screen)
    Review zyBook and assignments
    Review new grading policy
    Inheritance and Composition ("is a" vs "has a")
    Understand that subclasses have multiple types
    Understand the subtle differences between instanceof and getClass
    Properly define an equals method
    Observe polymorphic behavior

Files:

instanceof directory: This directory contains an inheritance hierarchy with overridden equals methods defined using the instanceof operator to check lineage. Run the Driver and examine the output to see strange equls method behavior

e1.equals(e2) -> true
e2.equals(e1) -> false

Should the equals method behave in this way?

getClass directory: This directory contains an inheritance hierarchy with overridden equals methods defined using a call to the inherited getClass() method to check lineage. Run the Driver and examine the output to see more reliable equls method behavior

e1.equals(e2) -> false
e2.equals(e1) -> false
